When the script is run, two tables are generated at the end:

- Measures:	This table has 81 columns and 10299 rows. In the first 79 columns there are 79 measurements related to
		any mean or standard deviation. In the 80th, we can read the SUBJECT, and in the last one, the ACTIVITES.
		All the rows corresponds to all lectures taken during all the experiment.
- Table 2:	The output file is called tidy_set.txt. It is a file of 79 columns and 36 rows. The columns contain 79 
		measurements related to any mean or standard deviation. The first 6 rows include the mean for the results
		for every activity. The following 30 include the mean for the results for every SUBJECT.

The 79 described measurements are grouped in the variable features. They are: 

"tBodyAccmeanX"

The activities are 6: 

"WALKING"
"WALKING_UPSTAIRS"
"WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS"
"SITTING"
"STANDING"
"LAYING"

Finally, the subjects, labelled from 1 to 30, represent the 30 individuals that performed the experiment.
